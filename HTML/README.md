# This section of my repo is for me to learn the basics of HTML

## Basic stuff like:

- What tags exist
- What tags to use when
- What is semantic HTML
- How do I validate my HTML
- How to setup a proper HTML page without CSS and JS

## How do I validate my HTML

< p>This is a paragraph< /p> <-This is a whole HTML-Element

< p > <- This is the opening tag<br />
This is a paragraph <- This is the Content<br />
< /p > <- This is the closing Tag<br />
